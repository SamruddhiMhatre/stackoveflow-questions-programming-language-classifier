# stackoveflow-questions-programming-language-classifier


[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) exercise to train a multi-class classifier to predict the tag of a programming question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

A dataset has been prepared to use containing the body of several thousand programming questions (for example, "How can sort a dictionary 
by value in Python?") posted to Stack Overflow. Each of these is labeled with exactly one tag (either Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). 
The task is to take a question as input, and predict the appropriate tag, in this case, Python.
